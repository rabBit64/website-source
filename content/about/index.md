Hi! I’m a senior undergraduate college student double majoring in English Language and Computer Engineering. I’m currently working as a computer lab assisant in Scalar Lab at Hongik University. I’m broadly interested in research topics relating to Natural Language Learning(NLP) where neural network models are theoretically capable of, especially computational linguistic approaches to parsing and natural language inference.
